# React.js Coding Fiesta 🚀
# Welcome to Git Buddies Page 🚀

🎉 Welcome to the React.js Coding Fiesta, where I'll embark on an adventure of fetching data, crafting web magic, and turning API sorcery into a splendid web app using the wondrous Next.js.

## The Great Quest 🏹

Our mission? Create two pages:

### The User List Page 📜

A default screen that summons Github users into a list. Behold their Avatars, First Names, Last Names, and Usernames! Each list item is a portal to the magical User Details page.

### The User Details Page 🌟

A sanctuary of detailed wisdom about the chosen one. Unveil extended profile secrets, like company and social handles. Revel in a summary of followers, following, and the number of public repositories.

## Enchantments and Gadgets 🧙‍♂️

Navigate through the coding realms with these magical considerations:

- **Data Fetching:** Marvel at the possibilities of Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- **Routing:** Chart your course through the mystical paths of routing.
- **Styling:** Cast spells for responsiveness to make your creation shine.
- **Component Composition:** Conjure the art of reusing Components for maximum wizardry.

## Incantations to Begin ✨

After summoning the project with create-next-app, utter these enchantments to bring it to life:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
