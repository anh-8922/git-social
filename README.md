# React.js Coding Challenge 🚀
# Welcome to Git Buddies Page 🚀

🎉 Welcome to the React.js Coding Challenge, where I'll embark on an adventure of fetching data, crafting web magic, and turning API sorcery into a splendid web app using the wondrous Next.js.

## Fetching GitHub Users API 🏹

Our mission? Create two pages:

### The User List Page 📜

An initial interface that assembles GitHub users into a structured list, presenting their Avatars and Usernames. Each entry serves as a gateway to the User Details page, offering a seamless navigation experience.

### The User Details Page 🌟

Explore an abundant source of detailed insights about the selected individual. Uncover comprehensive profile details such as professional affiliations and social media identifiers. Delve into a succinct overview of followers, followings, and the count of publicly available repositories.

### Summary 🧙‍♂️

In this project, I employed Next.js and TypeScript for efficient development. Axios facilitated HTTP requests and data retrieval. CSS modules ensured modular styling, and Next.js' built-in routing streamlined navigation. The application boasts responsiveness, featuring a main page listing all users, with dynamically generated routes for individual user pages for an enhanced user experience.
